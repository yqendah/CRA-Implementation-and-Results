0,CAN Injection attack to gain physical access to Toyota RAV4 car.
1,Gain physical access to the vehicle.
1.1,Bypass physical security (e.g., break into the vehicle).
1.2,Access the Headlight Connector Behind the Bumper.
1.3,Manipulate the wiring without triggering an alarm.
2,Deploy CAN Injector.
2.1,Connect the CAN Injector to the vehicle's CAN bus.

2.2,Use the CAN injector to send CAN frames onto the control CAN bus
2.2.1,Send CAN messages onto the bus
2.2.2,Synchronize timing to match valid CAN traffic
2.2.3,Bypass detection mechanisms, if present, to avoid triggering anomalies
2.3,Identify Critical ECUs on the CAN-Bus
2.3.1,Identify smart key ECU
2.4,Impersonate the target ECU
2.4.1,Impersonate the smart key
2.4.1.1,Reverse-engineer key validation protocol
2.4.1.2,Send Validation Messages
2.4.1.3,Avoid triggering error responses from ECUs when sending validation messages
3,Exploit CAN communication to propagate messages to other CAN-buses
3.1,Send forged CAN messages across the control CAN bus
3.1.1,Send key validation messages over the control CAN bus
3.2,Exploit the lack of internal communication security to propagate messages
3.2.1,Utilize forwarding mechanisms to copy CAN frames from the control CAN bus to the powertrain CAN bus
3.2.2,Avoid detection by ECUs monitoring communication on the buses
3.2.3,Exploit any vulnerabilities in the ECU firmware to ensure messages are accepted
4,Compromise the ECUs on different CAN buses
4.1,Compromise the engine ECU on the powertrain CAN bus
4.1.1,Send crafted CAN messages to deactivate the immobilizer
4.1.2,Exploit vulnerabilities in the ECU to disable immobilizer security features
4.2.3,Bypass security controls in the powertrain CAN to prevent interference
